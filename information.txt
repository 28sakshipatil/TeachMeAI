Here’s a complete summary for your Teach Me AI project, covering the working model, system design, and workflow. You can use this in presentations, documentation, or reports:

Teach Me AI – Summary
Project Title:
Teach Me AI – Learn by Teaching an Intelligent System

Working Model
Teach Me AI is an interactive learning assistant that helps users retain concepts better by making them teach the content back to an AI. The system evaluates the explanation, detects knowledge gaps, generates custom MCQs, and tracks learning progress. It mimics the Feynman technique, empowering users to learn by teaching.

Working Flow
Resource Input

User either:

Reads a topic from the in-built content library, or

Uploads their own resource (PDF/DOCX)

The system extracts and stores the clean text from the document as the "reference material".

Teach the AI

After reading, the user explains the topic via:

Text input or

Voice input (converted to text using Speech-to-Text)

The explanation is sent to the backend for semantic analysis.

AI Analysis

AI compares the user’s explanation with the original content:

Checks semantic similarity

Identifies missing, misunderstood, or incorrect points

A feedback report is generated detailing:

Coverage score

Missing concepts

Suggestions for improvement

Custom MCQ Generation

Based on the feedback and resource, the AI generates:

MCQs tailored to the user’s mistakes

Correct answer explanations

User takes the quiz and receives an accuracy score.

AI Quiz Buddy

For any incorrect answer, user can ask:
“Why is this wrong?”

The Quiz Buddy provides a simple explanation of the correct concept using GPT.

Progress Dashboard

Tracks:

Accuracy trends

Topics completed

Topics that need revision

Displays stats and charts on user’s performance

Smart Reminder System

If the quiz score is below a set threshold (e.g., 80%):

A reminder is sent after 5 days

User is encouraged to re-read and re-teach the topic

Here’s a Machine Learning Flow Summary for Teach Me AI, tailored to showcase how ML is integrated into the system:

Teach Me AI – Machine Learning Flow Summary
1. Data Collection
Input Sources:

User explanations (text or voice)

Uploaded resources (PDFs, DOCs)

Quiz responses and performance metrics

Stored Data:

Reference content (ground truth)

User-generated explanations

Feedback reports

MCQ responses, scores, and timestamps

2. Preprocessing
Text Cleaning:

Remove noise, formatting

Normalize case and punctuation

Text Extraction:

Extract raw text from uploaded documents

Speech-to-Text (if voice input):

Convert spoken explanations to text (using Whisper/Web Speech API)

3. NLP & Semantic Analysis (ML Integration)
Semantic Similarity Scoring:

Use pretrained models (e.g., BERT / Sentence-BERT)

Compare vector embeddings of:

User explanation

Ground truth content

Output: similarity score + keyword match

Misconception & Gap Detection:

Identify:

Missing concepts

Misunderstood or irrelevant points

Fine-tuned prompts with GPT for qualitative feedback

4. Personalized MCQ Generation (Prompt-Driven ML)
Custom Question Generator:

Uses feedback + resource content

GPT generates:

3–5 multiple choice questions

Answer keys

Short explanations for Quiz Buddy

5. Learning Analytics & User Modeling
Accuracy Score Calculation:

Based on quiz performance

Tracked over time

Progress Tracking Model:

Aggregates scores across topics

Highlights:

Strong areas

Topics needing revision

Drives smart notifications and revision suggestions

6. Smart Notification System (Lightweight ML Logic)
Logic-based model:

If score < 80%, schedule a revision reminder after 5 days

Could be enhanced with ML later (e.g., spaced repetition algorithm)

Future Scope (Advanced ML Options)
Feedback Classification:

Classify types of mistakes using clustering

Knowledge Retention Predictor:

Predict long-term retention probability based on score trends

Adaptive Learning Path:

Suggest topics to revise or learn next, using collaborative filtering
