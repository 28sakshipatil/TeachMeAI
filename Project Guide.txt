Great! Let‚Äôs break down how to implement the Teach Me AI project step-by-step. I‚Äôll guide you through it like a roadmap with milestones.

üöÄ Teach Me AI ‚Äì Implementation Guide

PHASE 1: Setup & Tech Stack

Tech Stack (Recommended)

Frontend: React.js (or Next.js)

Backend: FastAPI or Flask (Python-based)

AI & NLP: OpenAI GPT-4 API + HuggingFace Transformers (BERT/SBERT)

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Storage (optional): Cloudinary or AWS S3 (for documents)

Auth: JWT tokens (optional: Firebase Auth)

Project Initialization

Frontend: npx create-react-app teach-me-ai (or use Next.js for server-side rendering)

Backend: python -m venv env
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai pymongo transformers pdfplumber python-docx

Database: Create a MongoDB cluster (MongoDB Atlas) and make connection string.

PHASE 2: Core Functionality Modules

Document Input Module

Upload File (PDF, DOCX)

Use pdfplumber or python-docx to extract clean text

Store extracted text in MongoDB

Backend route: /upload-resource

Teach the AI Module

Frontend:

Text Input Field

Voice Input (Web Speech API)

Backend:

Compare user explanation to ground truth using:

Sentence-BERT (semantic similarity)

GPT prompt for difference detection

Return feedback JSON (score, missing points, comments)

Backend route: /analyze-teaching

Feedback Generator

Prompt GPT with both user explanation & reference

GPT returns feedback like:

Missing concept: "Newton‚Äôs Third Law not mentioned"

Suggestion: ‚ÄúExplain more about action-reaction force‚Äù

Quiz Generator

Use GPT to generate MCQs from:

Uploaded content

Mistakes identified in feedback

Backend route: /generate-quiz

Frontend:

MCQ interface

Track user selections, show results

AI Quiz Buddy

Frontend:

Each question has "Why?" button

Backend:

Send incorrect answer + correct option to GPT

GPT replies with mini explanation (e.g. ‚ÄúB is correct because‚Ä¶‚Äù)

Backend route: /explain-answer

PHASE 3: Tracking & Dashboard

Store quiz attempts & scores

In MongoDB:

{userId, topic, score, time, wrongAnswers, etc}

Dashboard UI (React)

Show:

Score progress chart

Weak topics

Number of attempts

Daily streaks (optional)

PHASE 4: Reminder System

Backend logic (cron job or background task)

If user scored < 80%

After 5 days, trigger email/notification

Implementation:

Celery with FastAPI

Or Firebase Cloud Messaging

Or simple Node.js cron scheduler

Send Notification/Email

‚ÄúTime to revisit ‚ÄòNewton‚Äôs Laws‚Äô! You can improve your score!‚Äù

PHASE 5: Final Polish & Launch

Add authentication (JWT or Firebase)

Improve UI (Tailwind CSS, animations, mobile responsiveness)

Create landing page

Deploy:

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Render / Railway / Heroku

DB: MongoDB Atlas

Bonus Features (Optional)

Gamify with badges and streaks

Add multi-language support

Add leaderboard (for school/college mode)

Export PDF of feedback report
